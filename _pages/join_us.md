**We are recruiting! Join the Plant Stress Resilience Lab!**

<div class="profile-full-width">{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/Recruit.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}</div>

Join us to study the tripartite gossiping within **plants**-**microbes**-**stress** through gene expression, gene editing and simple plants.

The PSR Lab is based in the Program in Plant Health Care, Academy of Circular Economy at National Chung Hsing University.

### Postgraduate students

Our lab aims to motivate student to become an independent scientist as well as a creative thinker. In the lab you can gain hands-on experience in **molecular genetics**, **transcriptomics**, **plant–microbe assays**, **CRISPR/gene editing**, and **redox/ROS imaging**, among other techniques. We work with *Arabidopsis thaliana* and *Fusarium oxysporum* in a collaborative setting with international connections. Projects centre on plant–microbe interactions and biocontrol. If you are interested in plant stress or microbial engineering, please contact me and we could have wee chat about your ideas.

### Undergraduate students

We welcome **summer and winter interns** and undergraduates who are interested in joining the lab. If you are considering applying for an **undergraduate research grant** (e.g. NSTC University Student Research), we are happy to work with you on project design and supervision—get in touch to talk about possibilities.

### Postdoctoral fellow

Positions may require your own project funding. For postdocs, our lab currently has a 3-year NSTC-funded project—we welcome discussions about potential support from this grant. You can also contact PI to work with you on external grant applications.
