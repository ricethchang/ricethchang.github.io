## Uncovering the puzzles of Plant-Microbe-Environment Networks 🌱🔬 ##
  
Our newly established lab tackles the molecular complexity of plant-microbe-environment interactions to develop sustainable agricultural solutions.

### 🧬 Principal Investigator
**Dr. Tao-Ho Chang (aka Dr. Rice)** - Molecular genetics and microbiology expert specializing in plant stress adaptation mechanisms.
  
### 🔬 Three Core Research Themes
**Biomarker Discovery Platforms** - *Arabidopsis*-based screening using transcriptomics to predict beneficial plant-microbe interactions.

**Fungal Biocontrol Engineering** - CRISPR-mediated reprogramming of *Fusarium oxysporum* from pathogen to plant protector.

**Redox Network Analysis** - Decoding reactive oxygen/nitrogen species signaling in plant-microbe-stress interactions.
  
### ⚗️ Key Research Tools
Transcriptomics • CRISPR-Cas Systems • Real-time ROS Imaging • *Arabidopsis thaliana* • *Fusarium oxysporum*
