## Plant Stress Resilience Lab: Uncovering the puzzles of Plant-Microbe-Environment Networks
The newly astablished Plant Stress Resilience Lab at Academy of Circular Economy, National Chung Hsing University represents the next solution in sustainable and circular agriculture, We're tackling the molecular complexity of plant-microbe-environment interactions with innovation.

### üß¨ Principal Investigator
Led by Dr. Tao-Ho Chang (aka Dr. Rice), our team applys molecular genetics and microbiology to understand the mechanistic basis of plant stress adaptation.

### üî¨ Three Core Research Pillars
**Pillar 1: High-Throughput Phenotyping & Biomarker Discovery**  
Developing *Arabidopsis*-based screening platforms that integrate transcriptomics and physiological assays to identify predictive biomarkers for beneficial plant-microbe interactions.

**Pillar 2: Precision Genome Engineering of Fungal Biocontrol**  
Leveraging CRISPR-Cas systems and synthetic biology approaches to reprogram the pathogenic arsenal of *Fusarium oxysporum* into protective mechanisms‚Äîessentially converting pathogenicity factors into plant defense enhancers.

**Pillar 3: Redox Network Analysis in Tripartite Interactions**  
Dissecting the spatiotemporal dynamics of reactive oxygen species (ROS) signaling cascades and antioxidant networks that mediate plant-microbe communication under abiotic stress conditions.

### ‚öóÔ∏è Methodological Arsenal
Our lab employs cutting-edge technologies including WGCNA (Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis), transcriptomics, CRISPR-Cas systems and real-time ROS imagings for pattern recognition in complex biological datasets.

**We're building the molecular foundation for next-generation stress-resilient crops through evidence-based biotechnological innovation.** üåæ‚ö°

*Because understanding plant stress at the molecular level is the key to feeding 10 billion people sustainably.*
