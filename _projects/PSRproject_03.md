## Project Overview

{% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/Project03.png" title="_Fusarium oxysporum_ CRISPR gene editing as novel materials for plant resilience" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}

This three-year research project develops an innovative CRISPR gene editing platform to transform pathogenic _Fusarium oxysporum_ strains into beneficial biological control agents. By systematically removing key virulence genes, we aim to create non-pathogenic fungal strains capable of providing cross-protection against soil-borne plant diseases. The project employs advanced ribonucleoprotein delivery systems and optimised transformation protocols to achieve precise genetic modifications whilst maintaining the fungus's competitive colonisation abilities. This biotechnology approach offers sustainable alternatives to chemical pesticides, addressing critical agricultural challenges through environmentally responsible crop protection strategies. The research establishes foundational technologies for next-generation biological disease management systems with broad agricultural applications.

## Project Aims

- Establish an optimised CRISPR gene editing platform for _Fusarium oxysporum_
- Create non-pathogenic _Fusarium oxysporum_ strains through targeted gene knockout
- Validate cross-protection efficacy and elucidate protective mechanisms
