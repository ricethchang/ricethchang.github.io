  title={Identification of the causal agents of guava scab disease (GSD) and evaluation of the control efficacy of <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> to GSD},
  author={Ya-Zhen Xu and Tao-Ho Chang and Siang-Shan Huang and Tsai-De Chang and Yi-Jia Lin and Shang-Han Tsai and Yuh Tzean and Ying-Hong Lin},
  abstract={Guava scab disease (GSD), which significantly impacts fruit yield during growth and post-harvest storage, was historically attributed to <i>Pestalotiopsis psidii</i>; however, recent taxonomic revisions have reclassified Pestalotiopsis species into the genera <i>Neopestalotiopsis</i> and <i>Pseudopestalotiopsis</i>. In this study, symptomatic guava tissues were collected from infected orchards in southern Taiwan for pathogen isolation and identification. Samples comprised diseased leaves, fruits, and branches of guava cv. Jen Ju Pa. Based on morphological observations and multilocus phylogenetic analyses, the causal agents of GSD in these fields were identified as <i>Neopestalotiopsis</i> spp., closely allied with <i>N. cubana</i> and <i>N. protearum</i>. Due to increasing concerns over fungicide resistance and environmental sustainability, we also explored biological control as an alternative strategy. Three endospores-forming bacteria strains (PM-SSH-B009, PM-SSH-B018 and PM-SSH-B060) were isolated from rhizosphere soil of local orchids in southern Taiwan and identified as <i>Bacillus amyloliquefaciens</i> by 16S rDNA sequencing. For PM-SSH-B009 and PM-SSH-B018, the gyraseA (<i>gyrA</i>) sequencing provided additional resolution consistent with <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i>; however, <i>gyrA</i> could not be resolved for PM-SSH-B060. <i>In vitro</i> assays demonstrated that these strains significantly inhibited the mycelial growth and spore germination of <i>Neopestalotiopsis</i> spp., causing abnormal swelling of germination tubes and hyphae. On detached fruit, three application timings were compared to assess practical efficacy. Co-inoculation and pre-inoculation with PM-SSH-B018 or PM-SSH-B060 reduced GSD severity, whereas post-inoculation was less effective. These findings support <i>B. amyloliquefaciens</i> as a promising component of integrated GSD management, and provide a foundation for subsequent studies to resolve the underlying antifungal mechanisms and optimize field deployment.},

  abstract={<b>Background</b> <br>The Food and Agriculture Organization has reported approximately 40 % of food loss due to damage from plant pests and diseases, including fungal infections. Continuous application of agrichemicals for controlling fungal infection cause the occurrence of fungicide resistance. <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp., major causal agents for strawberry anthracnose, have gained concern for fungicide resistance issues. <br><b>Methods</b> <br>We developed novel antifungal strategies in the present study by integrating multibranched flower-like ZnO (fZnO) and agrochemicals (trifloxystrobin). fZnO compounds were synthesised using an eco-friendly and efficient hydrothermal method. Charged polymers with steric structures, such as hydrophilic polyacrylic acid (PAA) and polyethyleneimine (PEI), were grafted onto fZnO surfaces to improve the suspension ability of the compounds. We used the grafted fZnO compounds in combination with the fungicide trifloxystrobin to evaluate the <i>in vitro</i> and <i>in vivo</i> activities. <br><b>Significant findings</b> <br>Grafted fZnO (80 ppm) and trifloxystrobin (100 ppm) effectively inhibited the growth of fungicide-resistant <i>Colletotrichum</i> spp. and limited strawberry anthracnose on leaves. PEI-grafted fZnO shows promise as an eco-friendly additive in sustainable agriculture due to its photocatalytic activity and ability to withstand environmental factors.},

  abstract={Plant-parasitic nematodes infect a diversity of crops, resulting in severe economic losses in agriculture. Microbial volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are potential agents to control plant-parasitic nematodes and other pests. In this study, VOCs emitted by a dozen bacterial strains were analyzed using solid-phase microextraction followed by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry. Fumigant toxicity of selected VOCs, including dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), 2-butanone, 2-pentanone, 2-nonanone, 2-undecanone, anisole, 2,5-dimethylfuran, glyoxylic acid, and S-methyl thioacetate (MTA) was then tested against Caenorhabditis elegans. DMDS and MTA exhibited much stronger fumigant toxicity than the others. Probit analysis suggested that the values of LC50 were 8.57 and 1.43 μg/cm3 air for DMDS and MTA, respectively. MTA also showed stronger fumigant toxicity than DMDS against the root-knot nematode Meloidogyne incognita, suggesting the application potential of MTA.},

  title={Degenerated Virulence and Irregular Development of <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>niveum</i> Induced by Successive Subculture},
  author={Tao-Ho Chang and Ying-Hong Lin and Yu-Ling Wan and Kan-Shu Chen and Jenn-Wen Huang and Pi-Fang Linda Chang},
  abstract={Successive cultivation of fungi on artificial media has been reported to cause the sectorization, which leads to degeneration of developmental phenotype, and virulence. <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>niveum</i> (Fon), the causal agent of watermelon Fusarium wilt, forms degenerated sectors after successive cultivation. In the present research, we demonstrated that subculture with aged mycelia increased the incidence of degenerations. To further investigate the differences between the Fon wild type (sporodochial type, ST) and variants (MT: mycelial type and PT: pionnotal type), developmental phenotypes and pathogenicity to watermelon were examined. Results in variants (PT2, PT3, PT11, and MT6) were different from ST with mycelia growth, conidia production and chlamydospore formation. Virulence of degenerated variants on susceptible watermelon Grand Baby (GB) cultivar was determined after inoculation with Fon variants and Fon ST. In root dipping methods, Fon variants showed no significant differences in disease progress compared with ST. Fon variants showed a significant decrease in disease progression compared with ST through infested soil inoculation. The contrasting results of two inoculation methods suggest that the degenerative changes due to repeated successive cultivation may lead to the loss of pathogen virulence-related factors of the early stage of Fon infection process. Therefore, cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs; cellulase, pectinase, and xylanase) activities of different variants were analyzed. All Fon degenerated variants demonstrated significant decreases of CWDEs activities compared with ST. Additionally, transcript levels of 9 virulence-related genes (<i>fmk1</i>, <i>fgb1</i>, <i>pacC</i>, <i>xlnR</i>, <i>pl1</i>, <i>rho1</i>, <i>gas1</i>, <i>wc1</i>, and <i>fow1</i>) were assessed in normal state. The degenerated variants demonstrated a significantly low level of tested virulence-related gene transcripts except for <i>fmk1</i>, <i>xlnR</i>, and <i>fow1</i>. In summary, the degeneration of Fon is triggered with successive subculture through aged mycelia. The degeneration showed significant impacts on virulence to watermelon, which was correlated with the reduction of CWDEs activities and declining expression of a set of virulence-related genes.},

  abstract={Owing to the exponential growth of the human population and the rising food demand, identifying sustainable antimicrobials for higher agricultural productivity becomes essential. In this study, hydrothermal precipitation for synthesizing versatile nanostructured zinc oxide particles (nZnOs), including nanorods (1D), nanoplatelets (2D), and multibranched flower-like particles (3D), was achieved by controlling pH values of source precursors and growth time. Hydrothermal synthesis is an eco-friendly process without the requirement of hazardous organic solvents. The antimicrobial properties of these nZnO particles were evaluated on different soil-borne plant pathogens. These pathogens are serious limiting factors in agriculture.

  abstract={Fusarium wilt of watermelon, caused by <i>Fusarium oxysporum</i> f. sp. <i>niveum</i>, is one of the limiting factors for watermelon production in Taiwan. In recent research, the phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL) gene expressed in the shoot base of the Fusarium wilt resistant line JSB was related to Fusarium wilt resistance. Phenylalanine ammonia lyase is the key regulatory enzyme in the phenylpropanoid metabolic pathway. The downstream products of phenolic compounds are considered to be involved in the complicated plant defence mechanisms. They could act as signal molecules, antimicrobial substances and/or structural barriers. To study the resistant mechanisms of Fusarium wilt, the resistant JSB line was examined for comparison of <i>F. oxysporum</i>-watermelon interactions with the susceptible Grand Baby (GB) cultivar.
